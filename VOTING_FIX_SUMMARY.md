# Voting Error Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
Students could not see candidates when trying to vote, showing an error that no candidates were available for their education level.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. Level Field Mismatch
- **AuthContext** was setting `user.level = 'DYNAMIC'` instead of the actual education level
- **CandidatesContext** was searching for candidates with `level: 'DYNAMIC'` 
- **Mock candidates** had proper levels like 'BACHILLERATO', 'BASICA_SUPERIOR', etc.
- **Result**: No candidates found because 'DYNAMIC' ‚â† 'BACHILLERATO'

### 2. Missing Candidates in Database
- The system had mock candidates defined in `dataTransition.js` but they were not loaded into the database
- Admin interface did not have easy access to load test/mock data

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Level Field Mismatch in AuthContext
**File**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
- Updated `login()` function to validate activation code and extract actual level
- Added fallback level detection from course name when validation fails
- Now sets proper levels like 'BACHILLERATO', 'BASICA_SUPERIOR', etc.

### 2. Enhanced Mock Candidates Template
**File**: `src/services/dataTransition.js`
- Added missing fields: `nivel`, `lista`, `color`, `slogan`, `experiencia`
- Converted `propuestas` from strings to arrays for better UI support
- Added consistent field mapping between `level` and `nivel`

### 3. Added Data Transition Panel to Admin Dashboard
**File**: `src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx`
- Added import for `DataTransitionPanel`
- Added new "üîÑ Transici√≥n Datos" tab
- Admins can now easily load mock candidates using "Reset a Mock" button

## Field Consistency Verification

### Candidates Fields
- ‚úÖ `level` - Used by database queries
- ‚úÖ `nivel` - Added for consistency with student records
- ‚úÖ `cargo` - Position (PRESIDENTE, VICEPRESIDENTE, etc.)
- ‚úÖ `lista` - Party/List name
- ‚úÖ `color` - UI color coding
- ‚úÖ `nombre`, `apellidos` - Full name
- ‚úÖ `propuestas` - Campaign proposals (as array)
- ‚úÖ `slogan`, `experiencia` - Campaign details

### Students Fields
- ‚úÖ `nivel` - Education level (matches candidate.nivel)
- ‚úÖ `curso` - Course name (1ro Bach A, 8vo B, etc.)

## Testing Instructions

### For Administrators:
1. Open Admin Dashboard
2. Go to "üîÑ Transici√≥n Datos" tab
3. Click "Reset a Mock" to load sample candidates and students
4. Go to "üèÜ Candidatos" tab to verify candidates loaded
5. Check different levels: BACHILLERATO, BASICA_SUPERIOR, BASICA_MEDIA

### For Tutors/Voting:
1. Use activation codes for different levels
2. Login should now correctly detect education level
3. Students should see candidates matching their level
4. Voting interface should show candidates grouped by position

### Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ BACHILLERATO students see Andrea (Presidente) and Roberto (Vicepresidente)
- ‚úÖ BASICA_SUPERIOR students see Valentina (Presidente) and Diego (Vicepresidente) 
- ‚úÖ BASICA_MEDIA students see Isabella (Presidente) and Sebasti√°n (Vicepresidente)

## Files Modified
1. `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx` - Fixed level detection
2. `src/services/dataTransition.js` - Enhanced mock candidates
3. `src/components/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx` - Added transition panel access

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Admin can load mock data via transition panel
- [ ] Activation codes detect correct education levels
- [ ] Students see candidates for their level only
- [ ] Voting interface displays candidates properly
- [ ] Database contains candidates with correct level field
